# Discussion 3: June 8, 2018
* Recursive language: Turing machine always halts and accepts or halts and rejects on all input
* Recursively enumerable, not recursive language: Turing machine always halts and accepts, but if it rejects it may not halt
* If a language is inherently ambiguous, it must have a nondeterministic CFG and cannot have a DCFG
## Final Topics
* Ambiguous grammars
* Unambiguous grammars
* Ambiguous languages
* Unambiguous languages
* Recursively enumerable language
* Recursive language
* Pumping lemma for CFGs and FSLs
* Construct a PDA
  * Describe the language modeled by a PDA
* Write CFGs for FSLs
* Can you have an:
  * ambiguous deterministic grammar? No. You can not come up with two parse trees for something if you have more than one choice.
  * ambiguous nondeterministic grammar? Yes. You can have two parse trees that are both correct.
  * unambiguous deterministic grammar? Yes. One parse tree, one choice.
  * unambiguous nondeterministic grammar? Yes. One parse tree, two choices; one doesn't work.
* Can you have an:
  * ambiguous deterministic language? ?
  * ambiguous nondeterministic language? ?. 
  * unambiguous deterministic language? ?
  * unambiguous nondeterministic language? ?
* If you have an inherently ambiguous language, it must have an ambiguous grammar
* Ambiguity: # of parse trees you can have; Determinism: number of choices you have
