# Discussion 3: June 8, 2018
* Recursive language: Turing machine always halts and accepts or halts and rejects on all input
* Recursively enumerable, not recursive language: Turing machine always halts and accepts, but if it rejects it may not halt
* If a language is inherently ambiguous, it must have a nondeterministic CFG and cannot have a DCFG
## Final Topics
* Ambiguous grammars
* Unambiguous grammars
* Ambiguous languages
* Unambiguous languages
* Recursively enumerable language
* Recursive language
* Pumping lemma for CFGs and FSLs
* Write CFGs for FSLs
