# Lecture 15: June 6, 2018
## Topics
* Landscape of CFLs
* DCFLs = languages of DCFGs
* Chomsky-Turing hierarchy
* Reductions
* Complexity theory
## Misc Review 
* If you need to prove something is NOT, use closure properties or pumping lemma
## Final Problems
* Show something is finite state
  * Give more than one answer; the more answers you give the more points you get
  * Use different methods of for proof of finite state (regex, DFA, etc.)
* Determine whether languages are deterministic/nondeterministic CFGs
* Finite state pumping lemma problem
* Context-free pumping lemma problem
* Construction of the intersection of two DFAs
* Prove a language is context-free by constructing a PDA
* Unforced handles
* Relationship of CFGs, FSLs, etc.
* Turing machine problems similar to last homework
