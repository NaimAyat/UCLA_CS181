## This Week
* Pumping lemma for context-free languages
* Prove the set of all pushdown automata are equivalent to the set of all context-free grammars
* Deterministic pushdown automata
## Examples of Context-Free Languages
* {ww<sup>R</sup>} is context-free
* L = {ww} is not
  * L<sup>even</sup> = { xy | x ≠ y and |x| = |y| }
  * L<sup>c</sup> = L<sup>even</sup> ∪ { odd-length strings }
