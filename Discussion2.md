# Discussion 2: April 13, 2018
## Closure of Regular Languages
* Union
* Intersect
* Kleene closure
* Concatenation
* Complement
### Methods of Proof
1. Construct a DFA or NFA algorithm
2. Define language in terms of closed operations
### Transitive Closure
* δ* vs δ
  * δ(Q, a) is a function from one state and one symbol to one state (function from (q,a) to q where a∈Σ)
* Σ* vs Σ
  * Σ
  * Σ*
