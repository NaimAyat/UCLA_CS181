## Strings
* Alphabet ≡ any finite set of symbols, except
  * Example: binary alphabet is {0,1}
  * Subset of C alphabet: {for, if, while, int, ...}
    * Note that elements like "for" are treated as one symbol, so for<sup>R</sup> is still "for"
  * Alphabets can contain ordered pairs: {(0,1), a, b, 1, 3, 4}
    * Note that (0,1) is treated as a single symbol here
* String ≡ word ≡ sequence of zero or more symbols from alphabet ∑
