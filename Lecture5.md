### Regular Sets (Languages Recognized by DFAs)
#### Closure Properties
* Let S, T be regular sets. Then:
  * S ∪ T is a regular set
  * S • T is a regular set
  * S* is a regular set
  * S ∩ T is a regular set
  * S<sup>R</sup> is a regular set (reverse)
  * h(S) is a regular set (homomorphism)
* Σ = { a, b }. L = { w | number of "a"s is twice the number of "b"s } 
  * Not finite state language (FSL)
