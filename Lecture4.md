## Hazards
* Undesired behavior in waveform, though not logically incorrect
### Eliminate Hazard #1
* Redundant implicant to cover transition
* Output no longer depends on the c-transition
  * Systematic solution
* Adds logic gate (less efficient)
### Eliminate Hazard $2
* Make sure delay of paths match to remove glitch
  * cX timing is same as cN
## Recap of Course Material
* Intro to digital design
  * Digital representation of info

* Combinatorial logic design
  * Representations
    * English, trush table, minterm list, equation, cubes, k-map
  * K-map minimization: prime implicants, distinguished minterms, cover
  * Don't cares
  * Sum-of-products, product-of-sums
