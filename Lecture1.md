### Today
* Preliminaries
* Motivations
* Informal intro to automata theory
* Math foundations
## Course Overview
* In order from least to greatest expressive power and greatest to least predictability:
  * Deterministic finite automaton (DFA)
  * Deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA)
  * Pushdown automaton (PDA)
  * Turing Machine (TM)
## Terminology
* ∪
* ∩
* s̅ ("s bar" with respect to some universal set)
* S-T (set difference)
* 2<sup>S</sup> or 𝒫(S) (power set)
* Cardinality, finite, infinite
  * Infinite: countable or uncountable?
* Relationships: =, ≠, ⊆, ⊂, ⊄
* Ordered pairs
* Cartesian product: x
  * R x S x T ≠ R x (S x T) ≠ (R x S) x T
* Graps: (V, E)
  * Verticies, edges
  * Undirected, directed
  * Labeled directed
  * Cyclic, acyclic
  * Rooted trees: (V, E, r) where r ∈ V
